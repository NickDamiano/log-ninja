Welcome to Log Ninja, let's slice some logs!
(ascii ninja)

Type the name of parent folder containing the logs or drag the folder here

Type the date and time in UTC yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm



recursively goes through root folder and creates a file with 

************ M3 Messages **************
log
log
log

************* Acu Debug *****************
log
log
log
log


so different log types

ACUdebug files
aircraftd.log
messages (modem)

aircraftd.log
mcp-bistMGr.sh.log
msc.log
pfe.log
platformMgr.log
wmgr.log
messages

so tomorrow, start with messages for modem.

find the right file based off date
unzip or open that file and do a grep 
calculate the start time based off time minus
calculate the end time based off time plus
if the first line of the file is after the start time, start there
if the last line of the file is before the end time, end there

it might not be the exact minute so if you want 13:40 and you have 13:39 and then 13:41, start at 13:41

if you hit that line, start to write into a temp file every line and loop until you see 
the end time, then close that file and write the tmp file concatenated onto the main log
file you are writing with the asterisks and the name of the file. that main log file will be date time stamp_sliced.log

maybe there's an option for do you want m3, s4, or both? saves time and if we don't care about the s4 for connectivity then we don't deal with it. 

after getting message


stretch goal handle date time that straddles two days zulu - shouldn't be too hard
